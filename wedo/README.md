Lab 5 - We Do
October 9, 2018

To my knowledge, all aspects of the lab have been correctly implemented.
I did not collaborate with anyone on this project,
but I received considerable guidance from the "double rainbow" example by Rachel Sulmonte. 
I spent approximately 2 hours completing the assignment.
