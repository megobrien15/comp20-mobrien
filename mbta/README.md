COMP20
Assignment 2

As far as I know, all aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented.

I did not work with anyone on this assignment. I received considerable
help from the COMP20 examples (geolocation_map.html) and borrowed a function
on the haversine function from StackOverflow (link to post with function is included in my code).
I also received guidance for checking if a user has allowed location tracking from
a StackOverflow post that is linked in the code.

I spent approximately 6 hours completing this assignment
