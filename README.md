Lab 9

1. This Git repository stores all of the progress I've made on projects this semester.
   The point of having a repository is for version control, so if I make any major mistakes, I don't have to waste lots of time trying to restore a previous, working version.
2. I liked the mbta assignment, because I liked writing in JavaScript and I also found that it was the easiest to see my progress and test my work with this project.
   I also liked this assignment because it was so clearly applicable tot he real world, and I also got to be somewhat creative without feeling too overwhelmed by all of the things I needed to do.
3. I think I have grown a lot, because I am much more comfortable exploring other code for helpful functions. I also feel like I understand the general idea of how the web and web programming works much better, which extends to many other aspects of life and learning.
4. The most important thing I learned in this course, as mentioned in number 3, was how to learn on my own and read documentation in order to incorporate other people's work into my own.
   For example, by the end of the course, I felt way more comfortable consulting documentation for the Spotify API and Google Maps API, because I understood enough about web programming to be able to follow along and continue learning even more.
   I also felt comfortable copying snippets of code from other examples or from postings on the Internet, because I felt confident in my understanding of the code enough to use it in my own work.
5. I would like to learn more about databasing, because I felt like I didn't actually understand that section of the course very well, except the minimum skills I needed in order to complete Assignment 3.
