Lab 4
October 2, 2018

To my knowledge, all aspects of the lab have been correctly implemented. 
I spent about 3 hours researching/googling to try to understand how to 
implement this lab in CSS, but only about half an hour actually writing
code once I figured out how it all worked. I also spent about an hour 
figuring out SSH keys for Git to work properly.
